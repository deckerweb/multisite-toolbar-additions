Those menus can only be setup & edited via WP Nav Menus by Super Administrators - but then they are visible for administrator user roles (`edit_theme_options` capability).

* NEW: Added new logic to prevent other users than super admins from editing those custom (nav) menus that are used within the Toolbar.
* UPDATE: Removed all CSS that was added in v1.5.0 -- it was annoying and should not longer be there for WordPress 3.8 or higher. I guess this is finally for the better! :)

* CODE: Improved modular structure of the plugin for better maintenance and performance.
