## Description 

> #### Quick Access to Super Admin Resources - Time Saver!
> This **small and lightweight** plugin just adds some missed and **very useful admin links** to your Toolbar / Admin Bar in Multisite installs, and even regular single site installs.

> Also included is support for some awesome, useful third-party plugins out of the box. So you might just switch from the backend or frontend of your site to the 'Network Wide Plugins' or access the 'Nav Menu' Settings of a sub site/blog.

### This Plugin ... 
- ... scratches my own itch!
- ... is *Quality Made in Germany*
- ... was created with love (plus some coffee) :-) - [if you like it consider donating](https://www.paypal.me/deckerweb)


## Installation 


### Installation Steps 
1. Installing alternatives:
 * *via Admin Dashboard:* Go to 'Plugins > Add New', search for "Multisite Toolbar Additions", click "install"
 * *OR via direct ZIP upload:* Upload the ZIP package via 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' in your WP Admin
 * *OR via FTP upload:* Upload `multisite-toolbar-additions` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. In your Network Dashboard network activate the plugin through the (Network) 'Plugins' menu -- or in a sub site dashboard: per-site activate this plugin through the (Site) 'Plugins' menu
3. Look at your toolbar / admin bar within the "My Sites" menu and enjoy using the new links there :)
4. If you want you could add a special custom Nav Menu via "Design > Menus" (best if using the main site of your Network for that) and assign it to the new "Multisite Toolbar Menu" menu location (only visible & accessable for Super Admins!). [(See FAQ here for more instructions)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/multisite-toolbar-additions/#faq)
5. Go and manage your Multisite Network :)

**Please note, this plugin requires WordPress 3.3 or higher in order to work!**

**Also note:** This plugin has NO settings page because I believe it's just not neccessarry. All customizing could be done via filters, constants and regular WordPress user roles & capabilities. As the plugin is only indended for a Super Admin (Network Admin) usage - that's the way to go. This way we can save the overhaul of an options panel/settings page, additional database requests, uninstall routines and such. End result: a lightweight system that just works and saves clicks & time :-).

**Multisite install:** Of course, it's fully compatible but have a look in the [FAQ section here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/multisite-toolbar-additions/faq/) for more info :)

**Single install:** The plugin WILL also working like a charm for regular non-Multisite installs - just without the network specific stuff. However, there's still A LOT (single) site specific stuff supported. So it's up to your use case :). -- I for myself use this plugin on each and every install because it SAVES ME A LOT OF CLICKS & TIME! ...and that was the very reason I've developed it, yeah :-)

**Own translation/wording:** For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/multisite-toolbar-additions/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that, just use a language file like `multisite-toolbar-extras-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the tools on "Other Notes").


## Frequently Asked Questions 


### Why another Multisite Toolbar plugin, there are already some others!? 
You're right! If you're happy with one of the others then that's absolutely great and you don't need to add or switch anything! :)

I just made this new plugin here for my own needs and some of my client admins. As I am an open source evangelist I like to release my stuff to the public to give back to the community!

Plugin developer David Decker: *What has proved its day to day usage and usefullness on more than 100 installs (Multisites and regular single site installs) before, could be used by many other (super) admins as well, right? :-)))*



### Does this plugin work with latest WordPress version and also older versions? 
Yes, this plugin works really fine with the LATEST WordPress branch 3.8+! :-)
And sorry, it DOES NOT work with WordPress versions older than 3.6 so please update your install if you haven't done yet :).



### How do I use the custom Nav Menu for Super Admins for the toolbar? 
All menu items via a Custom Menu - and at all other places in the Toolbar (a.k.a. Admin Bar) - are only visible and accessable for Super Admins. That means in a Multisite environment all admins who can manage the network. In regular WordPress (single) installs these are users with the Administrator user role.

Added Menu Location by the plugin is: "Multisite Toolbar Menu" (again: only for Super Admins)

Steps for setting up a menu:

* Create a new menu, set a name like "Super Admin Toolbar" or such...
* Setup your links, might mostly be custom links, or any other...
* Save the new menu to the plugin's menu location. That's it :)
* *Please note:* Every parent item = one main toolbar entry! So best would be to only use one parent item and set all other items as children.



### How can I adjust the position of my custom Nav Menu? 
Since version 1.4.0 of the plugin there's a filter for that. See this example that needs to be added to your theme's/ child theme's `functions.php` file or a functionality plugin. Try values between `1` and `100`:
```
add_filter( 'mstba_filter_super_admin_nav_menu_priority', 'mstba_custom_position_super_admin_nav_menu' );
/**
 * Multisite Toolbar Additions:
 *    Adjust Super Admin Nav Menu Position
 */
function mstba_custom_position_super_admin_nav_menu() {

	return 20;

}
```



### How do I use the custom Nav Menu for Site Admins for the toolbar? 
The usage is identical as the Super Admin menu - see above 2 questions for instructions!

Only difference: This Site Admins menu is only viewable by site admins but only Super Admins can setup and edit it!

The filter for the hook priority here is called `mstba_filter_restricted_admin_nav_menu_priority` -- and works in the very same as above!



### How can I adjust the position of Network admin "+ New" section? 
This could be easily done with the following example code that needs to be added to your theme's/ child theme's `functions.php` file or a functionality plugin. Try values between `1` and `100`:
```
add_filter( 'mstba_filter_network_admin_new_content_priority', 'mstba_custom_position_network_admin_new_content' );
/**
 * Multisite Toolbar Additions:
 *    Adjust Network Admin "+ New" Position
 */
function mstba_custom_position_network_admin_new_content() {

	return 80;

}
```



### Can I remove the "+ New" (new content) section in Network admin? 
Yes, it's possible! This line of code needs to be added to your theme's/ child theme's `functions.php` file or a functionality plugin:
```
/**
 * Multisite Toolbar Additions:
 *    Remove Network Admin "+ New" section
 */
add_filter( 'mstba_filter_display_network_new_content', '__return_false' );
```



### How are new resources being added to the toolbar/admin bar? 
Just drop me a note on [my Twitter @deckerweb](https://twitter.com/deckerweb) or via my contact page and I'll add the link if it is useful for Multisite/ Super Admins.



### Is this plugin Multisite compatible? 
Of course it is! :) Works really fine in Multisite invironment - for Super Admins.



### In Multisite, could I "network activate" this plugin? 
Yes, you could! Again, it's only displayed and useful for Super Admins. -- Activating on a per-site basis is also possible. Just decide what works best for you.



### Has this plugin any use for non-Multisite installs? 
Yes, of course! :) The plugin is *working like a charm* in single-site installs - just without the network specific stuff. However, there's still A LOT (single) site specific stuff supported. So it's up to your use case :).



### Special instructions for the supported 'BackWPup' plugin? 
Yes, I have some advise for you :) -- My plugin only adds any BackWPup resources to your toolbar if you didn't enabled the "Toolbar / Admin Bar option" on the BackWPup settings page.

* **Enable** BackWPup Toolbar / Adminbar = BackWPup handles its own stuff...
* **Disable** BackWPup Toolbar / Adminbar = Multisite Toolbar Additions will handle BackWPup's toolbar items :)



### Could certain sections/ item groups be removed? 
Yes, this is possible! You can remove the following sections: "My Sites" menu area (all network items) / "My Sites" menu area (all sub site specific items) / "Super Admin Nav Menu" group (all items) / "Network Plugin Support" (all network plugin items) / "(Sub Site) Plugin Support" (all site plugin items) / "(Sub) Site Specific Items" - useful to disable for specific Super Admin users...

To achieve this add one, some or all of the following constants to your main theme's/child theme's `functions.php` file, functionality plugin or MU plugin:
```
/**
 * Multisite Toolbar Additions:
 *    Remove Network Admin Specific Items
 */
define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_NETWORK_ITEMS', FALSE );

/**
 * Multisite Toolbar Additions:
 *    Remove Sub Site Specific Items
 */
define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_SUBSITE_ITEMS', FALSE );

/**
 * Multisite Toolbar Additions:
 *    Disable Custom Nav Menu for Super Admins
 */
define( 'MSTBA_SUPER_ADMIN_NAV_MENU', FALSE );

/**
 * Multisite Toolbar Additions:
 *    Disable restricted Custom Nav Menu for Site Admins
 */
define( 'MSTBA_RESRICTED_ADMIN_NAV_MENU', FALSE );

/**
 * Multisite Toolbar Additions:
 *    Disable Plugin Support for Network Wide Plugins
 */
define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_NETWORK_EXTEND_GROUP', FALSE );

/**
 * Multisite Toolbar Additions:
 *    Disable Plugin Support for (Sub) Site Specific Plugins
 */
define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_SITE_EXTEND_GROUP', FALSE );

/**
 * Multisite Toolbar Additions:
 *    Disable Site Specific Items
 */
define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_SITE_GROUP', FALSE );

/**
 * Multisite Toolbar Additions:
 *    Disable Nav Menu List Edit Items
 */
define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_LIST_EDIT_MENUS', FALSE );
```



### Could the the whole toolbar entries be removed, especially for certain users? 
Yes, that's also possible! This could be useful if your site has special user roles/capabilities or other settings that are beyond the default WordPress stuff etc. For example: if you want to disable the display of any "Multisite Toolbar Additions" items for all user roles of "Editor" please use this code:

To hide only from the user with a user ID of "2":
```
/**
 * Multisite Toolbar Additions:
 *    Remove Network Admin specific Items for user ID 2
 */
if ( 2 === get_current_user_id() ) {
	define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_NETWORK_ITEMS', FALSE );
}
```

To hide items only in frontend use this code:
```
/**
 * Multisite Toolbar Additions:
 *    Remove Network Admin specific Items from frontend
 */
if ( ! is_admin() ) {
	define( 'MSTBA_DISPLAY_NETWORK_ITEMS', FALSE );
}
```


**Final note:** I DON'T recommend to add customization code snippets to your main theme's/ child theme's `functions.php` file! **Please use a functionality plugin or an MU-plugin instead!** This way you can also use this better for Multisite environments. In general you are then more independent from theme/child theme changes etc. If you don't know how to create such a plugin yourself just use one of my recommended 'Code Snippets' plugins. Read & bookmark these Sites:

* [**"Code Snippets"** plugin by Shea Bunge](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) - also network wide!

### ⚡ 1.7.1 - 2014-04/05 
* *Unreleased - private beta version!*



### 🎉 1.7.0 - 2014-03-04 
* NEW: Highly improved "Nav Menu" support, all editable menus are now listed as sub level items for "Menus" entry. (Could be disabled via constant if needed.)
* NEW: As per user request I added an additional restricted Site Administrators toolbar menu. This is only effective in Multisite installs. Those menus can only be setup & edited via WP Nav Menus by Super Administrators - but then they are visible for administrator user roles (`edit_theme_options` capability).
* NEW: For Multisite, under "Plugins" added "Network Plugins" admin link for sub site admin areas - handy link to network wide plugins page.
* NEW: For Multisite, under "Themes" added "Network Theme Editor" admin link (respects all Editor disable stuff, hehe! :) for sub site admin areas - handy link to theme editor if needed.
* NEW: Added new logic to prevent other users than super admins from editing those custom (nav) menus that are used within the Toolbar.
* UPDATE: Removed all CSS that was added in v1.5.0 -- it was annoying and should not longer be there for WordPress 3.8 or higher. I guess this is finally for the better! :)
* UPDATE: Fixed double appearance of "Themes" and "Plugins" in Network Admin sublevel - now fixed for all instances :).
* CODE: Improved modular structure of the plugin for better maintenance and performance.
* CODE: Code and documentation tweaks and improvements.
* UPDATE: Extended and improved readme.txt file here.
* UPDATE: Updated German translations and also the .pot file for all translators!
* *Extended plugin support:*
 * NEW: Added support for "Stream" (free, by X-Team).
 * NEW: Added support for "Snitch" (free, by Sergej Müller).
 * NEW: Added support for "WPMS Admin Reports" (free, by Joe Motacek).

* For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/multisite-toolbar-additions/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that as well, just use a language file like `multisite-toolbar-additions-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the following tools).

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating and validating I recommend the awesome ["Poedit Editor"](https://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, macOS and Linux.


## Additional Info 
**Idea Behind / Philosophy:** Just a little lightweight plugin for all the Multisite Super Admins out there to make their daily network admin life a bit easier. I'll try to add more plugin support if it makes some sense. So stay tuned :).
